# BDK
A C standard library replacement with built-in math and cross-platform window creation functionality. This doesn't replace every feature of the C standard library but provides an alternative solution for the functionality you likely wanted anyway.

**IMPORTANT:** Please be aware that parts of this codebase are intentionally left unprefixed; thus, it is assumed incompatibility with some or potentially all of the C standard library. As this codebase grows, I will provide a more formal overview of what is and isn't prefixed and how it is intended to be used.
